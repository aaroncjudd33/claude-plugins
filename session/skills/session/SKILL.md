## Teams Messaging

Whenever any session command posts a Teams message, apply these rules without exception:

1. **Always end with the Claude signature** — no exceptions:
   `<p><em>Posted by Claude on behalf of Aaron Judd</em></p>`
2. **Always preview before sending.** Show the full message content and wait for explicit approval before calling `send_chat_message`.
3. **Always use HTML formatting.** `send_chat_message` body supports and renders HTML.
4. **Always open with an intro paragraph** (`<p>`) before the first section.
5. **Follow the HTML guide.** Read `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ajudd-claude-plugins/comms/skills/comms/references/teams-html-guide.md` before drafting any message.

Standard message template:

```html
<h2>Message Title</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intro — context, who this is for, why you're sending it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Section One</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Item</b> — detail</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Posted by Claude on behalf of Aaron Judd</em></p>
```
