# Session Skill

Governs session lifecycle across all project types (plugin, story, cab, personal, general).

## Epic Context — Cross-Story Research

When the active session has an `Epic` field, the epic file (`~/.claude/memory/epics/<key>.md`) is the canonical source for anything that crosses story boundaries: architecture decisions, blockers, open questions, and the story map.

**Check the epic file first** before investigating code or asking Jira when the question is architectural — decisions are already recorded there and re-investigating wastes time.

**Sibling story lookup:** When researching something that a sibling story may have already answered (data formats, API contracts, cross-repo contracts, design decisions), check the sibling's session file:
1. Open the epic file — find the story in the Stories table
2. Derive the repo slug from the story key or the Scope field in the sibling's session file
3. Read `~/.claude/memory/sessions/<repo-slug>/<story-key>.md`

Example: working on BPT2-6382 (frontend) and need the wire format for `periodId` — check BPT2-6379's session file (`~/.claude/memory/sessions/virtual-office/BPT2-6379.md`) before digging through code or calling Jira.

**When to use sibling sessions proactively:**
- Any question about data shapes, API contracts, or field formats that another story's SPIKE or backend work would have answered
- Cross-repo coordination ("what's the other side expecting?")
- When a blocker or open question in the epic points to a sibling story as owner

**Explicit "look across the epic":** If the user says "check what other stories found" or "look across the epic for X", read *all* sibling session files listed in the epic's Stories table and surface their open items, next steps, and relevant notes.

## Context Recovery After /clear

If the user asks "what was I working on", "did I work on BPT2-XXXX before", "find my session for X", or similar recall questions, suggest **`/session:search <query>`** — it searches session files and worklogs by story key or keyword without requiring an active session.

If the user runs `/clear` or mentions that context was lost, **immediately suggest running `/session:start`**:

> "Context cleared — run `/session:start` to restore your session state (branch, open items, next step) without re-explaining anything."

This is the primary recovery path. `/session:start` reads `_active` to identify the current session, then loads the session file and surfaces everything needed to resume. New developers especially should be nudged here — the workflow is not obvious without it.

## Teams Messaging

Whenever any session command posts a Teams message, apply these rules without exception:

1. **Always end with the Claude signature** — no exceptions:
   `<p><em>Posted by Claude Code on behalf of {USER_NAME}</em></p>`
2. **Always preview before sending.** Show the full message content and wait for explicit approval before calling `send_chat_message`.
3. **Always use HTML formatting.** `send_chat_message` body supports and renders HTML.
4. **Always open with an intro paragraph** (`<p>`) before the first section.
5. **Follow the HTML guide.** Read `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ajudd-claude-plugins/comms/skills/comms/references/teams-html-guide.md` before drafting any message.

Standard message template:

```html
<h2>Message Title</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intro — context, who this is for, why you're sending it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Section One</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Item</b> — detail</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Posted by Claude Code on behalf of {USER_NAME}</em></p>
```
