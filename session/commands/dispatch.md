# Session Dispatch

Assume the **dispatch role** (Session Skill § The three roles — the dispatch model). Dispatch is the coordinator of the three-role model: it **reads** `ready` `work`, **bundles** related entries, **sequences** them by their `depends-on` markers, hands implementation notes to fresh `code` sessions, validates the returned tree post-hoc, and decides done. It is **sessionless** — like `refine`, it creates **no session file** and never touches `_active`.

This command gives dispatch a **first-class start** so it no longer has to be bootstrapped by pasting a briefing note (acp-ajudd#71). Invoking `/session:dispatch` **is** the "told" that determines the role (role determination is told, not auto-detected — § The three roles): the command declares the context as dispatch, loads the discipline, and orients on the inbox.

## Scope — inbox zones only (plugin / personal)

The dispatch model exists only where there is a **local inbox to dispatch from**. In **work / general** repos there is no dispatch layer — work flows through Jira (`refine` → *Ready For Work* → a dev `code`s the story), and there is no local `_inbox.md` to coordinate. This command is therefore **advertised only in plugin/personal** (Session Skill § The three roles — role determination; `commands/start.md`). It stays **invocable** in any zone for the deliberate case, but in work/general it will tell you the model doesn't apply and stop.

## Key properties (mirror the dispatch role — § The three roles § Inbox write-authority)

- **The sole hub — strict cycle (acp-ajudd#74).** Dispatch is the **only** relay + validator between planning and coding; **planning and coding never exchange notes directly.** Legal edges are only `planning ──▶ dispatch ──▶ coding` and `coding ──▶ dispatch ──▶ planning`. A coding→planning message is a **two-hop relay** — coding emits `CODING ──▶ DISPATCH`, and dispatch re-emits `DISPATCH ──▶ PLANNING` (each note titled with its own destination, which is the human courier's routing instruction — acp-ajudd#69). Dispatch **relays a coding escape-hatch escalation up to planning without judging its relevance** — coding declares it; dispatch carries it.
- **Read-only + notes-only.** Dispatch **reads anything and everything** but **writes nothing to files** — it never creates, edits, archives, or consumes an inbox entry, and never edits plugin code. Its only outputs are **handoff notes** (`/session:handoff`) to `code` and `refine`. If a record needs writing, it routes the record-authoring to `refine` (the one inbox writer).
- **Communicates only via notes; never routes decisions to the human (acp-ajudd#63).** Dispatch talks to other roles through paste-block handoff notes, not by asking the human to decide. The human only *relays* paste-blocks between terminals. Dispatch may narrate what it is doing; it does not seek approval — the one exception is an **irreversible Teams send**, which always pre-gates to the human (§ Dispatch operating discipline).
- **Validates the tree, doesn't rubber-stamp (acp-ajudd#57/#63).** On a return note, dispatch validates the actual working tree against the entry's Done-whens — post-hoc, non-gating (deploy-then-validate — § The dispatch↔code loop) — then shows the human a `SAFE-TO-CLOSE` / `HOLD` close-signal.
- **Sessionless — creates no session file, no `_active` change.** A coding session already active stays active alongside this dispatch context, unaffected.

## Instructions

### 1. Resolve and Check Zone

Run `pwd`, extract the repo slug (last path component). Read `handle` per the Session Skill's handle lookup. Read `~/.claude/plugins/user-config.json` → `paths` and classify the zone (same logic as `session:start` / `refine`):

| Zone | Detection | Dispatch applies? |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **plugin** | pwd contains `pluginMarketplaceName` | **yes** |
| **personal** | pwd begins with `personalProjectsDir` (fallback: `/c/claude/`) | **yes** |
| **work repo (story/cab)** | pwd begins with `workReposDir` (fallback: `/dev/`) | no — Jira flow, no local inbox |
| **general** | anything else | no — no system of record |

**If the zone is work or general**, state plainly and stop — do not orient on an inbox:
```
This is a <work/general> repo — the dispatch model doesn't apply here (no local inbox to
coordinate; work flows through Jira / has no system of record). Nothing to dispatch.
```
Do **not** offer to create anything. Only proceed to Step 2 for plugin/personal.

### 2. Declare the Role and Load the Discipline

State the role explicitly so the context is unambiguous, and confirm the disciplines you are operating under (do not restate them in full — they live in the Session Skill):

```
Dispatch role assumed for <slug> (sessionless — no session file).
Operating under: read-only + notes-only · validate-the-tree not the report · communicate via
notes, never route decisions to the human (except an irreversible Teams send) · honor depends-on
before pulling.
```

The authoritative discipline is the Session Skill:
- **§ The three roles — the dispatch model** (roles, channels, one-inbox-writer, write-authority).
- **§ Dispatch operating discipline** (notes-only, validate-don't-punt, blocked→refine, reversibility-keyed human gate, **depends-on prereq-check**).
- **§ The dispatch↔code loop — deploy-then-validate** (the round-trip: hand off with Done-whens → code finalizes by default, NO HOLD → return `IMPLEMENTED-DEPLOYED` → dispatch validates post-hoc).
- **§ HALT** (standing down dispatched work cleanly — `Action: HALT` / `State: HALTED`).
- **§ Cross-Session Paste Handoff** (the role-aware block format dispatch emits).

### 3. Orient on the Inbox

Read `~/.claude/memory/sessions/<slug>/_inbox.md` and present what is dispatchable. Parse each `work` entry's `> [type: work · status: …]` line and its optional `> [depends-on: <id> — <reason>]` line (`references/inbox-convention.md` § Sequencing). Show only `work` (`ready` is dispatchable; `new`/`refining` is still being scoped by `refine` — list it dimmed as not-yet-ready). **Captures never appear** — they are not dispatchable work.

**Apply the prereq-check** (§ Dispatch operating discipline, acp-ajudd#67): for each `ready` entry with a `depends-on` line, a cited prerequisite is **met** only if it is `[DONE]` / `[CONSUMED → session …]` in `_inbox_archive.md`, else **unmet**. Mark an entry with any unmet dependency as **held** — not dispatchable until its prerequisite lands.

Present a dispatch board:
```
Dispatch board — <slug>

  Dispatchable now (ready, deps met):
    [acp-ajudd#NN]  <description>
    [acp-ajudd#MM]  <description>   (bundle candidate with #NN — same SKILL sections)

  Held (ready, but blocked by an unmet dependency):
    [acp-ajudd#PP]  <description>   ← depends-on #MM (not yet done)

  Still scoping (not ready — refine owns these):
    [acp-ajudd#QQ]  <description>   · refining
```
Omit any empty group. Note **bundle candidates** — entries that touch the same files/sections and could be handed off as one `code` order. If nothing is dispatchable, say so plainly.

### 4. Choose the Operating Mode — both first-class (acp-ajudd#71)

How this dispatch context gets its marching orders depends on whether planning and implementation are happening **concurrently** or **separated in time**. These are **situational, not primary/fallback** — pick by how the user is working. So the refine→dispatch channel is BOTH the inbox (autonomous pull) AND a planning handoff (directed plan) — dispatch handles either (this corrects acp-ajudd#57's inbox-only framing).

- **Concurrent — planning-directed.** The user is planning AND implementing in the same stretch. The **planning session holds the live context** — it just scoped the work and knows the dependencies — so it **computes order + grouping and hands dispatch an explicit plan** via a `/session:handoff` (a REFINEMENT/PLANNING handoff naming the sequence and bundles). In this mode, dispatch **acts on that pasted plan** rather than re-deriving it. *(Example 2026-07-13: planning sequenced #66 → #67 → #65, marked the `depends-on`, and handed it over.)* If the user pastes a planning handoff, follow it.

- **Deferred — dispatch-autonomous from the inbox.** The user planned earlier and is implementing later; there is **no live planner to direct dispatch**. Dispatch **works out order and grouping itself** from the board in Step 3 — reading the `ready` entries and their `depends-on` markers (acp-ajudd#67), bundling related work, and respecting the prereq-check. This is the mode this command's inbox orientation is built for.

If a planning handoff has been pasted into this terminal, run **planning-directed**. Otherwise default to **dispatch-autonomous** from the board. State which mode you are in.

**Before acting on ANY pasted handoff (a planning plan here, or a coding return note in Step 6), verify it is for you (acp-ajudd#69).** Run the receiving-side check — hard `Slug` match against `pwd` (always), plus a `<to-role>` match against this dispatch role (established-role check) — and **STOP + flag** on a mismatch instead of acting. The rule + mismatch messages live in **Session Skill § Cross-Session Paste Handoff → Receiving side — verify the target before acting**.

### 5. Dispatch — Hand Off to Code (and Report Up at Batch Kickoff)

**Report-up cadence — at each batch kickoff (acp-ajudd#74, absorbs #72 facet 4).** Kicking off a new batch is exactly when dispatch also reports on the whole roadmap. Alongside the `dispatch→code` work order below, ALSO produce:
- **(a) A roadmap status glance for the human** — where everything stands: waves done / in-flight / queued, plus what is still `refining` and any captures. One glance, not a full dump.
- **(b) A completion handoff back to planning** — a `DISPATCH ──▶ PLANNING HANDOFF` reporting what was **completed + validated** since the last report. This is the third leg of the loop (`dispatch ──▶ planning`), and it keeps planning in flow without planning having to ask. Emit it whenever there is validated work to report; skip only on the very first kickoff when nothing has completed yet.

For the chosen work (single entry or a bundle), emit a **dispatch→code work order** via `/session:handoff` (Session Skill § Cross-Session Paste Handoff owns the block format; this command does not restate it). The order is essentially `code #X` plus process instructions:
- **`Action: PICK UP #X`** (or `PICK UP #X,#Y (bundle)`), role `dispatch (<slug>) ──▶ coding (fresh)`.
- **The note carries the *run*, not the *spec*** — never regurgitate the entry's body; the coding session reads the entry itself. Attach watch-fors, the bundle sequencing, and the report-back protocol.
- **Include the finalize-by-default instruction** — tell the coding session to self-verify against the entry's Done-whens and **finish/deploy on its own authority (NO HOLD)** unless it hits an escape-hatch reason (question / unclear / disagreement / found-problem); the footer must be **command-invoking** — run `/session:handoff` to reply with a `State: IMPLEMENTED-DEPLOYED` (or stop-reason) block back to dispatch (acp-ajudd#43).
- If ordering is blocked or a `depends-on` is unmet and the sequence is unclear, route a note to **`refine`** (never a question to the human).

### 6. Validate the Return — Post-Hoc, Non-Gating

When the coding session's return handoff comes back (`State: IMPLEMENTED-DEPLOYED` or a stop-reason), validate the **actual working tree** against the entry's Done-whens — read the diff / the files, do **not** rubber-stamp the report (§ The dispatch↔code loop, leg 4). This is not a gate; the deploy already happened. Then show the human a terse `SAFE-TO-CLOSE` / `HOLD` close-signal. If the post-hoc look finds something off, hand back a `FIX` note (one more deployment). Release any work that was **held** on this entry as a dependency once it is `[DONE]` / consumed.

### 7. Done — Touch Nothing

Dispatch is read-only + notes-only: it wrote **no** session file, changed **no** `_active`, and created/edited/consumed **no** inbox entry. Everything it produced was handoff notes (relayed by the human) and, where a record was genuinely needed, a note to `refine` to author it. The dispatch context stays alive and lean to drive the next item.
