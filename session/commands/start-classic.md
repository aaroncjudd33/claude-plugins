# Session Start — Classic Flow (Steps 2-4)

Loaded by `start.md` (the dispatcher) once zone and the config-cascade have been resolved. Context already in scope: `slug`, `session_root`, `handle`, `zone` (`plugin` | `story` | `cab` | `personal` | `general`), and `filter_mine` (if Step 0's `mine` fast-path set it). This is the **`startFlow: classic`** fallback for every zone — one file, zone-aware inside, same shape as `start-wizard.md` (acp-ajudd#124); the default flow is `start-wizard.md`, classic is opt-in via `startFlow: classic`. Renamed from `start-plugin-classic.md` (acp-ajudd#123 perf-tune), which also pushed this flow's three model-generated blocks — the Step 3 routing block, the plugin/personal inbox display, and the plugin-session resume block — into scripts (`routing-block.py`; `inbox-render.py`'s `pickup`/`resume` modes; `resume-block.py`), so the command echoes deterministic stdout instead of composing that text token-by-token on every session:start. Each call still has a documented model-rendered fallback for when the script is unavailable — behavior is unchanged either way, only the common-path cost drops. **acp-ajudd#132 later collapsed the story/cab Step 3 render into one script (`start-panel.py`); acp-ajudd#142 (2026-07-20) made `start-panel.py` zone-aware and extended the same one-echoed-block treatment to plugin/personal/general, retiring their `routing-block.py` + `inbox-render.py pickup` + `session-list.py` assembly.**

## Instructions

### 2. Load Sessions

The listing is rendered by a helper script so its deterministic formatting (grouping, title truncation, column widths, the active marker) is not generated token-by-token. **Issue the render call and the Step 3 input call(s) together in one response — do not process any result before all are issued.**

1. **Render the listing — run the retention prune, then the list script, and display the list stdout verbatim:**
   ```bash
   ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<pluginMarketplaceName>/session}"
   # Retention prune (acp-ajudd#50) — archive completed sessions >6mo BEFORE listing, so the
   # table reflects the pruned set. Idempotent, fail-safe, and never touches in-progress/paused.
   if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "$ROOT/scripts/session-archive.py" ]; then
     python3 "$ROOT/scripts/session-archive.py" --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>"
   fi
   SL="$ROOT/scripts/session-list.py"
   if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "$SL" ]; then
     python3 "$SL" --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>" --handle "<handle>" --rebuild-index
   fi
   ```
   The prune runs first and completes before the listing (and before any commit a later step such as `migrate` might make). If it prints a `Retention: archived …` line, relay it to the user before the table so an archival is never silent.
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is used when set; otherwise the script resolves from the marketplace clone — derive `<pluginMarketplaceName>` as in the dispatcher's Zone Detection.) The script reads `_index.md` (7-col current / 6-col legacy), the per-session inbox files (`_inbox_<name>.md`, archives excluded), the `_active` marker, and the session `.md` filenames itself, then prints the finished, aligned, grouped table — default columns, with completed and `refinement-*` sessions hidden. **Display its stdout exactly as printed: do not re-align, re-order, restate, or wrap it in a code fence.**

**Every zone defers to the one-echoed-block panel (acp-ajudd#130/#132/#142).** Do **not** emit the session table in this step for **any** zone — run the retention prune above (and relay any `Retention:` line), but **defer the whole panel to Step 3**, which renders it in one shot via `start-panel.py --zone <zone>` (verbs → primary content → Advanced, shaped per zone). This was originally a story/cab-only carve-out (#130/#132); #142 extends it to plugin/personal/general too, retiring their old three-piece assembly (`routing-block.py` + `inbox-render.py`'s `pickup` call + `session-list.py`) the same way story/cab already collapsed to one script call.

   **`_active` self-heal (acp-ajudd#94).** During this `--rebuild-index` pass the script also **clears an `_active` marker that points at a session whose status is `completed`** — a completed session can never be the active pointer. (Under the un-bundled ship/close model a session may legitimately sit *shipped but still active* until `/session:finish` runs; once it is `completed`, a lingering `_active` is stale and is removed here.) Fail-safe: a heal error never breaks the listing.

2. **Step 3 inputs (same parallel batch):**
   - **Consolidated / global inbox (all types) — render via `inbox-render.py` (acp-ajudd#102):** the consolidated inbox is a per-item dir `<session_root>/_inbox/`; render it so its stdout is the same `_inbox.md`-shaped stream Step 3 parses. This call also **auto-migrates** a legacy single `_inbox.md` on first access (lazy, self-healing — `references/inbox-convention.md` § Per-item storage mechanics); relay any one-line migration notice it prints on **stderr** before the table.
     ```bash
     RENDER="$ROOT/scripts/inbox-render.py"
     if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "$RENDER" ]; then
       python3 "$RENDER" render --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>"
     fi
     ```
     Parse its stdout for Step 3's routing block — list items, flag `[spawn]` entries with ★. If neither `python3` nor `python` (nor the script) is available, fall back to reading `<session_root>/_inbox/*.md` directly (or a legacy `<session_root>/_inbox.md` if the dir is absent). (The `session-list.py` script counts only per-session `_inbox_<name>.md` files; the consolidated inbox is separate and comes from this render.)
   - **Non-plugin type:** repo-memory count —
     ```bash
     RTOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null); if [ -n "$RTOP" ] && [ -f "$RTOP/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md" ]; then grep -c "^\- \[" "$RTOP/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md"; else echo "no-repo-memory"; fi
     ```
   - **Plugin type:** read `<marketplace_root>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (used in Step 3).

**Filter flags** — when the user's reply is a deterministic filter, re-run the script with the matching flag and display the new stdout verbatim:
`full` → `--full` · `all` → `--show all` · `refinement` → `--show refinement` · `status <value>` → `--status <value>` · `mine` → `--mine`

**Free-text natural-language filters** (`has inbox`, `updated by nivi`, `paused this week`) are not deterministic — read `_index.md` yourself and render the filtered subset inline (the one case the model still formats), then re-show the routing block.

**Index rebuild — automatic (acp-ajudd#49).** `_index.md` is a derived render cache, gitignored in repo-based sessions and **not committed** — so its absence (e.g. on a fresh clone or after `git pull`) is the **normal case, not an error**. The `--rebuild-index` flag above makes `session-list.py` derive any missing rows straight from the committed session files and silently persist the rebuilt cache, so the listing is always correct with no committed index. The manual `index` command is now rarely needed; if the user types `index`, just re-run the script (it re-derives and re-persists).

**Example of the script's output** (this is what the script prints — echo it as-is, do not regenerate):
```
Sessions in virtual-office

  #  name       title                            status       in  last edit

  In Progress
  1  CAB-9240   BP2 - Downline Reports - SG...   in-progress  0   @ajudd May 27  ←
  2  BPT2-6377  Shopify Member Agreement Pro...  in-progress  1   @nivi Jun 11

  2 in-progress · 1 paused · 8 completed
```

**Fallback (script unavailable)** — if `python3` is absent, the script exits non-zero, or stdout is empty, render the listing yourself: read `_index.md`; group by status (In Progress, Paused; Completed only on `all`); one row per session — `# · name · title (≤32 chars, "..." if longer) · status · in-count · @updater date` (add `out` + `@creator created-date` only on `full`); mark the `_active` session with `←`; skip `_`-prefixed files and `refinement-*` (unless `refinement`/`all`); end with `N in-progress · N paused · N completed`. Plain unaligned text is fine in the fallback.

If repo memory was found (Step 3 input above), add one line after the sessions table:
```
  Repo memory: N entries
```
Omit entirely if `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` does not exist.

If `session_root` does not exist or is empty, skip this section.

### 3. Present Routing Block and Wait

**Unmatched fast-path target (acp-ajudd#155).** If `start.md`'s Step 0 fast-path fell through into this flow with `unmatched_target` set (a plugin/personal arg that matched no session file), don't silently present the bare panel as if nothing was typed — run this step's own free-text matcher (§ Free-text and search below) against `unmatched_target`, using the inbox/session data already rendered in Step 2, *before* waiting for a reply:
- **Matches one or more** inbox items or sessions by name/title/id → show them filtered (`(filtered by '<unmatched_target>')`), same as a typed free-text reply would.
- **Matches nothing** → say so plainly instead of dead-ending: `No inbox item or session matches '<unmatched_target>'. Start fresh: refine <unmatched_target> to scope it, then code it when ready.`
Either way, still show the full panel below it (the match result is a supplement, not a replacement) — the point is the target is never dropped without at least one attempt to place it.

Output the routing block and wait for one free-text reply. **Do not use AskUserQuestion.** Output the routing block as plain text — do not wrap it in a fenced code block and do not add a separator line (`---`) before it.

**Free-text and search:** If the user types text that doesn't match a routing action, interpret it as a natural-language filter — match against name, title, handle, status, inbox count, or any session field. Accept plain descriptions like `has inbox`, `updated by nivi`, `created by me`, `paused`, `completed this week`. Re-display the filtered table with `(filtered by '<query>')` and re-show the routing block. If no sessions match and the text looks like intent rather than a filter, proceed naturally. Keywords `mine`, `all`, `backlog`, `index`, `status`, `refine`, `code` are handled directly (see Step 2 and the `refine`/`code` entries in the shared inputs below).

**Parse combinations freely.** A single reply may include multiple signals — session number, modifiers, inbox dispositions. Examples: `1`, `code 1`, `code reviewed-work 2`, `code release`, `2 yes 4 skip`. A bare number or session name alone is treated as `code` it. Infer intent; speak up only if genuinely ambiguous.

**Shared across all project types** (defined once — the per-type blocks below add only their type-specific `Refine / Code` lines and inputs):

Every routing block ends with this same **Search by** section — append it to whichever type block you render:
```
  Search by:
    mine             — show only your sessions
    all              — include completed sessions
    full             — show all columns (adds out count + created date)
    status <value>   — filter by in-progress / paused / completed
    <text>           — search name or title, or describe a filter (e.g. "has inbox", "updated by nivi")
```

Every type also accepts these same inputs (in addition to its type-specific ones):
- Number or session name alone (`1`, `<name>`) → `code` it (the file decides — resume if it's an in-progress session, graduate if it's a `work` entry)
- `code <target>` → enter a **coding session** on `<target>` (see the `code` entry below)
- `mine` → filter to sessions where @created-by or @updated-by matches current user; re-display and re-show routing
- `all` → re-display including completed sessions; re-show routing
- `full` → re-display the table with the full 8-column set (adds `out` count + `created` date); re-show routing
- `status <value>` → filter to that status; re-display and re-show routing
- `refine [target]` → enter the **refinement** flow (analyze-then-scope; `commands/refine.md`) — **planning, sessionless: it never creates a session file**. Applies to every type — `session:start` is the front door to refine. It writes **work** directly into it (a `work` entry for plugin/personal, a Jira story for work repos). With a topic (`refine shopify refund window`) → scope new work directly (folds in the old `new`: this is how new work begins — scope the work first). With an existing work reference (`refine acp-ajudd#12`, `refine BPT2-6429`) → resume refining that work in place (a `capture` given as target is promoted to `work`). Bare `refine` → surface resumable **`refining` work** for the slug (for plugin/personal, the `refining` `work` entries; for work repos, stories in *Gathering Requirements* via `/story:dashboard`), then resume one or start new. Direct `/session:refine` and this verb converge on the same flow. The target is **strictly the zone — no override, no target picker**: plugin/personal → a `work` entry (unambiguous); work repo → Jira story (project resolved-or-confirmed, not assumed `BPT2`); general → **nothing created** (a general repo has no system of record; only a `/session:inbox` capture can leave). Graduation = flipping the work to `ready` / *Ready For Work* — and **refine stops there; it never offers to `code`** (that is a separate, deliberate gesture). See Step 4 → **Refine — enter refinement flow**.
- `code <target>` → enter a **coding session** on `<target>` (`commands/start-impl.md` owns the mechanics). **The file decides what happens** — one verb, two outcomes: if `<target>` already has a **session file** (an in-progress session by name, or its sessions-table `#`) → **resume** it; if `<target>` is **work** (a plugin/personal `work` entry by list `<n>` or stable `[id]`; a work-repo Jira `KEY`) → **graduate** it into a *fresh* coding session — Jira story → *In Progress*, `work` entry → consume/fold-archive (a session file is born). `code` not-fully-scoped work (`new`/`refining`) **warns but never blocks** (acp-ajudd#1) — you scope as you build. This folds in the old `resume` (session) and `pick` (work). Direct `/session:start code <target>` and the fast-path share this path. **`code <target> lite`** (a trailing `lite` token — acp-ajudd#154/#143, `references/lite-mode.md`) → same graduation, but pre-answers the session-vs-lite question with `lite`: the new-kickoff prompt is skipped entirely and the lite path is taken directly (still announced with one line, e.g. `Going lite on BPT2-6532 — no session file, updates via Jira comments.`, never silently). Applies to a fresh resume too — resuming a target already at `status: in-progress` (lite) doesn't need the token at all, since it's already lite (§ lite-resume check, `start-impl.md`).
- Any other text → natural-language filter; match against name, title, handle, status, inbox count, or any field; re-display with `(filtered by '<query>')` and re-show routing

---

**Plugin project:**

Sessions are **item-driven**: new work always starts from a `work` entry in the inbox — there are no blank or plugin-named sessions. Scoping new work first is `refine`.

**One echoed panel (acp-ajudd#132/#142).** The whole plugin-zone panel — `Quick start` (verbs, including the secondary `dispatch`/`capture` lines), `Inbox` (primary — the pickup list you `code` to graduate), `In Progress` (sessions), and `Advanced` (`memory`/`search` only — inbox is already primary above, not collapsed here) — is rendered by **one script**, the same `start-panel.py` the work zone uses, zone-branched via `--zone plugin`. This retires the old three-piece assembly (`routing-block.py` + `inbox-render.py`'s `pickup` call + `session-list.py`) — do **not** reassemble it by hand. Run it and display stdout **exactly as printed** — no code fence, no restating:
```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<pluginMarketplaceName>/session}"
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
RTOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
python3 "$ROOT/scripts/start-panel.py" --zone plugin --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>" \
  --handle "<handle>" --current-branch "$BRANCH" --repo-root "$RTOP" --limit 5
```
`start-panel.py`'s Inbox section reuses `inbox-render.py`'s `render_pickup()`/`collect_work_items()` as library calls (not a second subprocess) — layout B, `[spawn]` starred, `· <stage>` suffix for `new`/`refining`, provenance dimmed, and the trailing "Captures waiting: N" glance all carry over unchanged. Reading captures (on request only — `check captures`, or "read the capture from `<repo>`") still follows `references/inbox-convention.md` § Captures inbound: disposition each — **promote** (→ `refining`), **discard**, **absorb into the current session**, or **feed a refinement** — the three non-promote fates **archive** the capture.

**Echo-compliance applies here exactly as it does for the work zone (acp-ajudd#133/#138) — see that section below for the full note; it is not repeated per zone.** Your entire response for this step is the command's stdout, character-for-character — no preamble, no restated question, no `AskUserQuestion`, and no dropped header/rule line.

**Fallback (script unavailable)** — if `python3` is absent, the script exits non-zero, or stdout is empty, render it yourself in the same order and shape: the verbs block (refine/code + dispatch/capture, underlined header), then the Inbox list (number each `work` entry with its stable `[<id>]`, `[spawn]` starred, `· <stage>` suffix, provenance dimmed below — parse the `> [type: … · status: …]` line per `references/inbox-convention.md` § Inbox Model back-compat; `capture`-type entries never appear in the list, only in the trailing `Captures waiting: N` glance; `Inbox: none — scope new work with 'refine <topic>'` if empty), then `In Progress` (`session-list.py --limit 5`, no title column), then `Advanced` (`memory`/`search` only).

**Type-specific accepted inputs** (plus the shared inputs above):
- `dispatch` → read `commands/dispatch.md` and run it (assume the dispatch role, orient on the inbox — sessionless; creates no session file).
- `capture` → read `commands/capture.md` and run it (assume the capture role, bank ideas as `capture`-type entries — sessionless; creates no session file).
- `code <n>` / `code <id>` where the target is a **`work` entry** → graduate it into a fresh feature-named coding session, **or pick it up lite** (acp-ajudd#154/#143 — read `start-impl.md`'s Work Pickup step 1a first: it asks session-vs-lite before anything else, default session). On the **session** path: reads start-impl.md, goes to Step 4 (new session): derive a feature name (confirmed once), fold the entry body into the new session, then archive-on-consume — append a `[CONSUMED …]` copy to `_inbox_archive.md`, then **delete the item's `_inbox/<id>.md` file** (fold-then-archive — the session plus the archived copy is the trail; acp-ajudd#40 / #102). On the **lite** path: no session file is written at all — see `references/lite-mode.md`. `<n>` is the ephemeral inbox list position; `<id>` is the stable handle (e.g. `acp-ajudd#3`) — accept either. **If the work is not fully scoped — `status: new` or `refining`** (parsed from its `> [type: work · status: …]` line — keyed on status, *not* on origin), warn and confirm first: `[<id>] is not fully scoped (status: <new|refining>) — code it anyway? You'll scope AND build; refine first if it's big. (yes / leave it)`. A `ready` entry (the default) codes with no warning. **Never blocks** — a capable coding session decides based on size. (A `capture`-type entry isn't in this list — `code` a capture only after it's promoted to `work`.)
- `code <n>` / `code <name>` where the target is an **in-progress session** → resume it (the Plugin session resume path in Step 4). `<n>` is the sessions-table row; `<name>` is the feature name. A bare number that matches a row in **both** the sessions table and the inbox is the only genuinely ambiguous case — ask which; otherwise infer.
- `refine [target]` → scope work first (see shared inputs). **New plugin work begins here** — `refine build the <x> plugin` creates the `work` entry; `code` it when it's ready (the plugin folder/marketplace scaffolding then happens inside that coding session). Sessionless — creates no session file.
- `<n>` / `<name>` alone → `code` it (shorthand for the above).
- `reviewed` → mark plugin reviewed after loading (when the resumed session targets a plugin).
- Combinations: `code 2 reviewed` / `code acp-ajudd#12`.

**Work project:**

**One echoed panel (acp-ajudd#132).** The whole work-zone panel — `Quick start` (verbs), `In Progress` (detailed, capped, underlined headers), `Advanced` (inbox / memory / search), and the branch note — is rendered by **one script** so the command just echoes it verbatim. Do **not** re-order, re-render, hand-format, or "improve" any part: that latitude is exactly what made the panel drift (compact vs detailed In Progress two runs apart from the same instruction). Run it and display stdout **exactly as printed** — no code fence, no restating:
```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<pluginMarketplaceName>/session}"
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
RTOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
python3 "$ROOT/scripts/start-panel.py" --zone work --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>" \
  --handle "<handle>" --current-branch "$BRANCH" --repo-root "$RTOP" --limit 5
```
`start-panel.py` reuses `session-list.py`'s parsers (so its In Progress rows match the `sessions` full list), folds the active/completed/stale summary into the `In Progress` header, caps at `--limit` with a `… +M more — type 'sessions'` overflow, shows `@who` when the session records it (else just the date), and prints the branch note only when that session isn't already in the list. (This replaces the former three-piece assembly of `routing-block.py --search none` + `session-list.py --limit` + a hand-written more-line — the assembly the model kept deviating from.) If Step 2's prune printed a `Retention:` line, it was already relayed there.

**Echo-compliance is not automatic (acp-ajudd#133).** This step's failure mode observed in practice is not a script or layout bug — it's the model discarding `start-panel.py`'s stdout and substituting its own conversational summary ("Session panel loaded for X … 8 active sessions … what would you like to do?") or, worse, an `AskUserQuestion` picker. Both are violations of this step, not acceptable alternatives. So the rule for this specific step is absolute and overrides any general instinct to summarize or to offer a picker:
> **Your entire response for this step is the command's stdout, character-for-character — nothing else.** Do not write a preamble, a summary sentence, a restated question, or any text of your own before or after it. Do not call `AskUserQuestion`. The panel already contains the verbs, the list, and the prompt — paste it, then stop.

**How to apply it:** run the `start-panel.py` call above, take its stdout, and output that stdout as your entire message — no code fence around it, no leading "Session panel loaded" line, no trailing question in your own words. If you notice yourself about to write a sentence describing the panel instead of pasting it, that is exactly the drift this note exists to stop — paste the stdout instead. (See `project_script_echo_compliance` memory for the root cause: this is a model-mediated slash command, so echo-compliance must be re-earned by instruction on every read of this file, not assumed as a given.)

**A subtler form of the same drift (acp-ajudd#138): dropping ONE header/rule line while every content line survives.** Observed live twice in a row on `virtual-office` — the `Advanced` section's own header+underline line went missing from the reply while its `inbox` / `memory` / `search` content rows printed correctly, verbatim, in the right place. This is not a wholesale summary-instead-of-paste failure (§ above) — it is a partial one, and worth naming separately because it is easy to mistake for a script bug (it is not: `start-panel.py` writes its entire output as a single atomic string; there is no code path that omits one header while keeping that same section's content). If your reply is missing a header or rule line that the stdout above clearly contains, that is this drift — the fix is the same: reproduce the stdout exactly, including every header and rule line, not just the "informative" rows.

Then wait for one free-text reply. **Do not use AskUserQuestion.**

**Expand keywords — the collapsed detail is one word away:**
- `inbox` → render the consolidated inbox in full: run `inbox-render.py render` and show its `work` items in **layout B** (description-first, provenance dim below; `[spawn]` starred; drop `<slug>` when it equals the current repo; `work` only — `new`/`refining`/`ready`, capture-type excluded), then the captures-waiting glance `Captures waiting: N — say "check captures" to read them` (omit if zero). Then re-show the panel. Full inbox handling (work/done/backlog/keep) happens at Step 5.
- `sessions` / `all` → re-render the **full** session table (`session-list.py --rebuild-index`, no `--limit`; add `--show all` for `all`), then re-show the panel.
- `search` → run `routing-block.py --zone work` (default `--search full`) to show the full **Search by** options, then wait again.
- `memory` → the on-demand `load memory [topic]` capability (repo memory); surface only on this keyword.
- `check captures` → read + disposition capture-type entries (promote / discard / absorb / feed — the three non-promote fates archive), per `references/inbox-convention.md` § Captures inbound.

**Fallback (start-panel.py unavailable)** — if `python3` is absent, the script exits non-zero, or stdout is empty, render the panel yourself in the same order and shape: the `Quick start` verbs (refine `<n|KEY>` / code `<n|KEY>` / cab `<KEYS>`, underlined header), then a detailed `In Progress` list from `session-list.py --limit 5` (or `_index.md` if that also fails), then an `Advanced` block (`inbox` / `memory` / `search`). Keep the underlined headers and the folded summary.

**Type-specific accepted inputs** (plus the shared inputs above):
- `code <KEY>` (e.g. `code BPT2-6429`) → open a coding session on that story — the file decides: a session already exists → resume it; no session yet → graduate the story (transition to *In Progress*, create the feature branch, kickoff). If no key in the reply after a bare `code`, ask "Story key or URL?" as follow-up.
- `code <n>` → resume the in-progress session on the compact-list row `<n>`.
- `cab BPT2-XXXX [...]` (bare `cab`, no `code` prefix) → new CAB coding session for those stories (routes to `/release:create-cab`); if no keys in the reply, ask "Story keys? (space-separated)" as follow-up. `code cab …` is still accepted as a legacy synonym. **Before routing** — session-vs-lite choice (acp-ajudd#154/#143 — `start-impl.md`'s "CAB — new" / `references/lite-mode.md`, default session): asked once, same wording as the story/plugin prompt. `lite` still routes to `/release:create-cab` exactly as today (CAB kickoff mechanics are unaffected); it only changes whether `session` also writes a parallel session-state file on top — updates instead post as Jira comments on the CAB issue. **`cab <KEYS> lite`** (a trailing `lite` token, same shortcut as `code <target> lite`) → pre-answers the question and skips the prompt, announced with one line (e.g. `Going lite on this CAB — no session file, updates via Jira comments on the CAB issue.`).
- `refine [target]` → scope a story first (see shared inputs) — creates/edits a Jira story in *Gathering Requirements*; never a session file. **New story work Heber hands over is already refined upstream — you'll mostly just `code BPT2-XXXX`.**
- `code <n>` on a global inbox `[spawn]` item → route through the spawn flow.

---

**Personal project:**

Identical model to plugin (per design — plugin and personal behave the same). Sessions are item-driven: new work starts from a `work` entry in the inbox, never blank.

**One echoed panel, identical mechanics to the plugin block above (acp-ajudd#132/#142) — only `--zone personal` differs:**
```bash

Same `Quick start` / `Inbox` (primary) / `In Progress` / `Advanced` (`memory`/`search` only) shape, same echo-compliance rule, same fallback (render it yourself in the same order and shape — see the plugin block above for the full fallback description, identical for personal). Reading captures on request follows the same `references/inbox-convention.md` § Captures inbound flow.

**Type-specific accepted inputs** (plus the shared inputs above):
- `dispatch` → read `commands/dispatch.md` and run it (assume the dispatch role, orient on the inbox — sessionless; creates no session file).
- `capture` → read `commands/capture.md` and run it (assume the capture role, bank ideas as `capture`-type entries — sessionless; creates no session file).
- `code <n>` / `code <id>` where the target is a **`work` entry** → graduate it into a feature-named coding session (same fold-then-archive flow as plugin: Step 4 → start-impl.md; the entry's `<id>` is preserved in the folded provenance block). Same `new`/`refining` warn/confirm as plugin — keyed on the entry's `status`, not its origin. Never blocks.
- `code <n>` / `code <name>` where the target is an **in-progress session** → resume it. Same both-lists disambiguation as plugin (ask only on a genuinely ambiguous bare number).
- `refine [target]` → scope work first (see shared inputs) — **new personal work begins here**; creates/edits a `work` entry, never a session file.
- `<n>` / `<name>` alone → `code` it (shorthand for the above).

---

**General / unknown project:**

**One echoed panel (acp-ajudd#132/#142).** General has no formal work-item system (`refine` creates nothing here — a general repo has no system of record), so there is no primary Inbox section — just `Quick start` (`refine`/`code` only — no `cab`, no `dispatch`/`capture`), `In Progress` (sessions), and `Advanced` (`inbox`/`memory`/`search`, all always-rendered per acp-ajudd#135 even though inbox is normally 0 here — a `work`-type entry could in principle still land in this zone's inbox via a cross-repo `/session:inbox` handoff, so it's counted honestly rather than assumed away):
```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<pluginMarketplaceName>/session}"
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
RTOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
python3 "$ROOT/scripts/start-panel.py" --zone general --session-root "<session_root>" --slug "<slug>" \
  --handle "<handle>" --current-branch "$BRANCH" --repo-root "$RTOP" --limit 5
```
Same echo-compliance rule as the other zones (§ Work project above). If any `capture`-type entries exist in this zone's inbox, they still surface only via the "Captures waiting: N" glance (never in a primary list) — read/disposition only on request, per `references/inbox-convention.md` § Captures inbound.

**Fallback (script unavailable)** — render the panel yourself in the same order and shape: `Quick start` (`refine [topic]` / `code [name]`, underlined header), `In Progress` (`session-list.py --limit 5`, no title column), `Advanced` (`inbox`/`memory`/`search`).

**Type-specific accepted inputs** (plus the shared inputs above):
- `code <name>` → open a coding session named `<name>` — the file decides: no session file with that name → new kickoff (if no name/context in the reply, ask "Name and what you're working on?" as follow-up); existing session → resume it.
- `code <n>` → resume the in-progress session on sessions-table row `<n>`.
- `refine [topic]` → scope verbally (see shared inputs); a general repo creates **no work entry** — the only outbound is a `/session:inbox` capture to another slug.

### 4. Act on User's Reply

Once the user replies, act immediately. **Do not read start-impl.md first** for the plugin resume path below.

**One-of-each advisory (read-only — acp-ajudd#41).** Before acting on a **`code`** action (whether it graduates a `work` entry or resumes a session), reuse the in-progress sessions already gathered in Step 2 (or `_active` + `_index.md` status — do **not** run a new scan). If an in-progress **coding session other than the one about to be started or resumed** already exists for this slug, print exactly this one line, then proceed normally:

  `Note: coding session '<name>' is already active for this slug — starting here makes two (one-of-each discipline).`

This is **read-only** — it never blocks, prompts, or asks; it just surfaces the fact once. Same "one glance, no monitoring" spirit as the captures-waiting glance (acp-ajudd#10, § Captures inbound), and it keeps the honor-system "one planning + one coding per repo" invariant (acp-ajudd#30) visible without a hook (acp-ajudd#1). It does **not** apply to the Refine path below — refine is sessionless planning and carries its own advisory in `commands/refine.md`.

---

**Refine — enter refinement flow** (any type; triggered by `refine` / `refine <topic>`):

The `session:start` refine verb and the direct `/session:refine` command converge — both run `commands/refine.md`, which owns the analyze-then-scope flow and the zone-aware graduation. Refine creates **no session file** — the work-in-progress lives in the work it produces (a `refining` `work` entry for plugin/personal, a *Gathering Requirements* Jira story for work repos), so "resumable refinements" are those `refining` `work` entries, not any `refinement-*.md` file. Handle the reply:

- **`refine <topic>`** → scope new work on `<topic>` directly: read `commands/refine.md` and run it from Step 1, passing `<topic>` as the argument.
- **`refine <target>`** (a `work` entry `<id>` like `acp-ajudd#12`, or a Jira key like `BPT2-6429`) → resume refining that existing work: read `commands/refine.md` and run its Step 1 resume path with the reference. (A `capture` given here is promoted to `work` first.)
- **bare `refine`** → first surface resumable `refining` work for the slug, then route:
  1. **Plugin / personal:** first, if any `capture`-type entries exist in the Step 2 rendered inbox, show the captures-waiting glance so the `capture ─▶ refine` loop closes here (acp-ajudd#96 — bare refine is where planning drains the hopper): `Captures waiting: N — say "check captures" to triage them` (omit if zero; this mirrors the glance `refine.md`'s bare path owns). Then list the `refining` `work` entries already rendered from `<session_root>/_inbox/` in Step 2 — the entries whose `> [type: work · status: refining]` line marks them still-being-scoped (legacy `> [status: refining]` still parses; missing type/status → `type: work · status: ready`, so those are NOT listed here). Present:
     ```
     Refining (resumable):
       1  [acp-ajudd#12]  <summary>   — last touched MM-DD
     Resume one (refine <id> / <n>), or scope new: refine <new topic>
     ```
     **Work repo:** hand straight to `commands/refine.md` — its bare-`refine` path **lists your *Gathering Requirements* stories inline** (assignee OR reporter = me), so no story key need be memorized; pick one to reopen (prints its status first) or `refine <new topic>` to scope new. (refine.md owns the JQL + the status-tiered edit guard — acp-ajudd#55.)
  2. **`refine <id>` / `<n>`** → resume that work (Step 1 resume path). **`refine <new topic>`** → scope new. If there is no `refining` work, skip the list and ask the topic directly ("What are we refining? (a short topic)"), then scope new.

Either path lands in `commands/refine.md` — the front door and the direct command share one implementation.

**Plugin session — resume existing:**

**Display — script-rendered (acp-ajudd#123).** `resume-block.py` does all three reads itself (session file, `_history.md` tail, and the consolidated inbox via `inbox-render.py`'s `resume` mode — item-driven per-item `_inbox/` dir, auto-migrates on access, `references/inbox-convention.md` § Per-item storage mechanics; there is no per-session `_inbox_<name>.md` for plugin/personal) and prints the "Resuming `<name>`" block followed by the inbox+reviewed batch prompt, in one call. It also **drops the in-progress/pending dual state** the generic per-session-inbox template (story/cab) carries — the item-driven consolidated inbox structurally has no in-progress marker (pickup consumes immediately, § Lifecycle), so every listed entry is inherently pending; this trims that dead branch rather than reproducing it (acp-ajudd#123 Done-when: no other-zone-model branches).

Run **the render and the security-check hash in parallel:**
```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<pluginMarketplaceName>/session}"
RESUME="$ROOT/scripts/resume-block.py"
if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "$RESUME" ]; then
  python3 "$RESUME" --session-root "<session_root>" --name "<name>" --slug "<slug>" \
    --handle "<handle>" --plugin-root "<plugin_root>" --inbox-render "$ROOT/scripts/inbox-render.py"
fi
git hash-object "<session_root>/<name>.md"
```

**Security check (repo sessions only):** If `session_root` is inside a repo (not `~/.claude/memory/sessions/`), gate **displaying** the rendered stdout above on the approval-hash check — never show it before the gate clears. Follow the same gate as start-impl.md Step 4: compare `hash_now` (from the parallel call above) to `~/.claude/memory/sessions/<slug>/<name>.approved-hash`, and require approval on first load or when the file changed since last approval. For local plugin sessions (`session_root` is under `~/.claude/`), skip this check and display the rendered stdout immediately.

Once cleared, display `resume-block.py`'s stdout verbatim — no re-ordering, no re-formatting.

**Fallback (script unavailable)** — if `python3` is absent, the script exits non-zero, or stdout is empty, compose it yourself:
```
Resuming <name>
  Branch:      [branch]
  Open items (mine, N):
    - [date @handle] item
  Inbox (N items):          ← layout B; provenance dim below each entry (see inbox-convention.md); `work` only (new/refining/ready); every entry is pending (no in-progress state in this inbox model)
    1  [<id>]  <description> — pending
       ↳ <slug> / <session> (<type>) · MM-DD
  Captures waiting: N — say "check captures" to read them   ← omit line if none; captures-waiting glance (acp-ajudd#10, § Captures inbound)
  Next steps (mine, N):
    - [date @handle] step
  Loaded memories (N):
    - <name>  [<label>]
  Recent commits (N):
    - [date] <sha> — <subject>
  History:     N entries — last: [condensed one-liner]

(1) Inbox: "<desc>"  →  work / done / backlog / keep
(2) Plugin reviewed? (last: v<stored>, current: v<current>)  →  skip / yes

Reply with overrides or "go".
```
- **Updated by** is intentionally not shown here — it's already in the listing the user just saw.
- **Memory:** do not print a standalone global-memory hint line. The on-demand `load memory [topic]` capability still applies; surface it only if the user asks.
- Omit teammate sections if no items tagged with a different @handle.
- If inbox empty: `Inbox: none`. If history file missing: `History: none`.
- **Loaded memories:** read from the session file's `Loaded memories:` field. Omit the line entirely if the field is absent or empty. If present, append the hint `— say 'reload' to load them back into context` (do not auto-read the files — on-demand rule). On `reload`, read each listed memory file from the resolved project memory root.
- **Recent commits:** read from the session file's `Commits:` field. Show the most recent 3; omit the line entirely if the field is absent or empty.
- Mine vs. teammate: item is mine if tagged `[YYYY-MM-DD @<handle>]` matching current user, or untagged.
- Plugin reviewed check: `grep -o '"version": "[^"]*"' "<plugin_root>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" | head -1` — compare MAJOR.MINOR of `Plugin reviewed:` field vs current. Show only if they differ. Omit the whole batch block entirely if inbox is empty AND plugin version unchanged.

Apply the user's reply the same way regardless of which path rendered the prompt:
- **work**: add `[inbox] <short desc>` to session Open items. (No in-progress marker is written — the item-driven inbox has no such state; picking it up for real is a separate `code` action that consumes it per the state-exclusivity model, § acp-ajudd#13.)
- **done** (bucket 1 — COMPLETION): archive with `[DONE YYYY-MM-DD]` stamp, remove from inbox, remove matching `[inbox] <item>` from Open items if present. Valid because this resume enters a coding session closing work it built.
- **backlog** (bucket 3 — planning disposition): move to `_backlog_<name>.md` (create if needed), remove from inbox.
- **keep**: leave as-is.
- **reviewed yes**: update `Plugin reviewed: <current-version>` in session file.

Write state:
- `<session_root>/<name>.md` — updated-by `@<handle>`, updated date = today, Status = in-progress, Open items = post-inbox state.
- `~/.claude/memory/sessions/<slug>/_active` — session name (plain text).
- `_index.md` — find line starting with `<name> | ` and replace (or append): `<name> | @<created-by> | <created-date> | @<handle> | <today> | in-progress | <title-or-dash>`.

Read `<plugin_root>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `<plugin_root>/skills/<plugin>/SKILL.md` in parallel. Ask what needs to change.

---

**Plugin / personal — `code <n>` / `code <id>` on a `work` entry** (item-driven session creation — graduation):

`code` a **`work` entry** graduates it into a fresh coding session. Read `session/commands/start-impl.md` immediately and continue from Step 4 there (New session path). `<n>` is the ephemeral list position shown in Step 3; `<id>` (e.g. `acp-ajudd#3`) is the stable handle — accept either. start-impl.md derives the feature name, folds the entry body into the new session (preserving its `<id>` in the provenance block), and archive-on-consumes the entry — a `[CONSUMED …]` copy to `_inbox_archive.md`, then **deletes the item's `_inbox/<id>.md` file** (acp-ajudd#102). The retired ID is never reused.

> **No `new` verb.** New plugin/personal work is not created-and-coded in one gesture (that would be coding-without-scoped-work). Scope it first with `refine <topic>` — which mints the stable ID and writes the `work` entry as `_inbox/<id>.md` — then `code` that work when it's ready. If the user insists on going straight to code on a brand-new idea, run `refine` to lay down the `work` entry first, then `code` it (a still-`refining` entry codes with the warn, per the shared `code` input).

**All other cases** — read `session/commands/start-impl.md` immediately, then continue from Step 4 there:
- Work / story / cab / general `code` action (the file decides: resume an existing session, or graduate/kickoff when none exists)
- Any case requiring a follow-up question (story key, session name)

<!-- Steps 4–9 for new sessions and non-plugin types are in start-impl.md -->
